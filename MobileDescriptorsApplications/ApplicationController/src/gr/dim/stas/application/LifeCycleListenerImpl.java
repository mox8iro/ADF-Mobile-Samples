/**
 * This auto-generated application life cycle listener provides the basic structure for
 * developers needing to include their own functionality during the different stages of
 * the application life cycle.
 *
 * Common examples of functionality that might be added:
 *
 * start:
 *   1. determine if the application has updates
 *   2. determine if there already exists a local application database image
 *   3. setup any one time state for the application
 *
 * activate:
 *   1. read any application cache stores and re-populate state (if needed)
 *   2. establish/re-establish any database connections and cursors
 *   3. process any pending web-service requests
 *   4. obtain any required resources
 *
 * deactivate:
 *   1. write any restorable state to an application cache store
 *   2. close any database cursors and connections
 *   3. defer any pending web-service requests
 *   4. release held resources
 *
 * stop:
 *   1. logoff any remote services
 *
 * @see oracle.adfmf.application.LifeCycleListener
 *
 * NOTE:
 * 1. Even though this is auto generated, it is not auto registered (see #2) since doing
 *    so could incur startup of the JVM in cases where it may not otherwise be necessary.
 * 2. In order for the system to recognize an application life cycle listener
 *    it must be registered in the adfmf-application.xml file.
 * 3. Application assemblers must implement this interface if they would like to
 *    receive notification of application start, hibernation, and application resume.
